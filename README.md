This short script is for verifying that an NHI number meets the requirements for being valid (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHI_Number), which might be useful for testing medical software.
It can also generate random valid NHI numbers (WARNING: numbers generated may match existing NHI numbers for real people!).
